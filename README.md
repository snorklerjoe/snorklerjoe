### Hello! 

I deeply enjoy tinkering with electronics, and love getting into software projects as well.  
When the two can intersect, that's where I am doubly fascinated!

A handful of my projects are documented and/or published here.


### I'm currently working on...
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://blog.hosticlefifer.com/), a website I wrote & host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server
<br>

## A few of my more note-worthy projects:
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition
- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/aprs-weather-station)

- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), a laser-scanning confocal microscope

<br>

When I'm not tinkering with electronics or writing code, you can find me observing pond life under a microscope, playing the reed organ, or on the air with amateur radio.

73!
