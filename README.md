## Hello! 

I deeply enjoy tinkering with electronics, and love getting into software projects as well. When the two can intersect, that's where I am doubly fascinated!

A handful of my projects are documented and/or published here.

### Current projects
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://blog.hosticlefifer.com/), a website I wrote & host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server

### A few things I've worked on...
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition
- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/aprs-weather-station)

- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), a laser-scanning confocal microscope
- [trebsim](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/trebsim), a MATLAB trebuchet simulation

When I'm not tinkering with electronics or writing code, you can find me watching pond life under a microscope, playing the reed organ, or on the air with amateur radio!

73!
