## Hello! 👋

A handful of my projects are documented and/or published here.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition I am helping to start.

🍳 The Back-burner ...
- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog/?show=14)
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog), a website I wrote & host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server

🥘 The slightly-more-distant back-burner ...
- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), the _laser-scanning confocal microscope_ I've been working on
- [trebsim](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/trebsim), a MatLab trebuchet simulation

When I'm not tinkering with electronics or writing code, you can find me watching pond life 🦠 under a microscope or playing the organ! 🎵
