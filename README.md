## Hi there 👋

I'm a student with deep interests in electronics and computer science.

A small handful of my projects are documented and/or published here, including:

- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition I am helping to start.
- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), a _laser-scanning confocal microscope_ I've been working on since 2017

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer)

🍳 The Back-burner ...
- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog/?show=14)
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog), a website I host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server

🥘 The slightly-more-distant back-burner ...
- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm)
- [trebsim](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/trebsim)
