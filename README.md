## Hello! 👋

A handful of my projects are documented and/or published here.

🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition I am helping to start.
- [rpi-mongo](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/rpi-mongo), scripts for making unofficial docker images of MongoDB to _bring MongoDB to Raspberry Pi computers_.

🍳 The back-burner ...
- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/aprs-weather-station)
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog), a website I wrote & host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server

🥘 The slightly-more-distant back-burner ...
- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), the _laser-scanning confocal microscope_ I've been working on
- [trebsim](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/trebsim), a MATLAB trebuchet simulation

When I'm not tinkering with electronics or writing code, you can find me watching pond life 🦠 under a microscope, playing the organ 🎵, or on the air with amateur radio!

73!
