## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

A handful of my projects are documented and/or published here.

ðŸ”­ A few things I've worked on...
- [CubeServer](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/CubeServer), the software backbone of a high-school STEM competition
- [Pixels Journal Data Processing](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/PixelsJournal-data-processing), an application for advanced data processing using data exported from Teo Vogel's "Pixel Journal" app
- [rpi-mongo](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/rpi-mongo), scripts for making unofficial docker images of MongoDB to _bring MongoDB to Raspberry Pi computers_.

- [Designing a compact Arduino APRS radio transmitter](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/aprs-weather-station)
- Maintaining [Hosticlefifer.com](https://www.hosticlefifer.com/blog), a website I wrote & host on a raspberry pi running Ubuntu Server

- [confocal-lsm](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/confocal-lsm), a laser-scanning confocal microscope
- [trebsim](https://github.com/snorklerjoe/trebsim), a MATLAB trebuchet simulation

When I'm not tinkering with electronics or writing code, you can find me watching pond life under a microscope, playing the reed organ, or on the air with amateur radio!

73!
